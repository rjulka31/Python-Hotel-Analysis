# Python-Hotel-Analysis

The objective of a Python hotel analysis project using Pandas typically revolves around gaining insights and making data-driven decisions based on the data collected from hotel operations. Here are some common objectives for such a project:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - Explore and understand the structure and content of the hotel data.
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. **Descriptive Analytics:**
   - Calculate key metrics such as occupancy rates etc.
   - Segment data by various dimensions (e.g., room category, date, customer type) to understand patterns and trends.

3. **Performance Monitoring:**
   - Track and monitor performance metrics over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Identify seasonal variations and trends in occupancy and revenue.

4. **Customer Insights:**
   - Analyze customer booking patterns, preferences, and behavior.
   - Segment customers based on demographics or booking behaviors to tailor marketing strategies.
